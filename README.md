# Some ideas from GPT

That sounds like an exciting and challenging set of projects! Cryptography is a vast field, and there are many more techniques and topics you can explore, especially with Rust's performance and security features. Here are additional cryptography-related projects that could complement your existing ideas:

### 1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
   - Implementing AES encryption and decryption from scratch. 
   - You can explore both ECB (Electronic Codebook) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes of operation, as well as key expansion and padding schemes.

### 2. **HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)**
   - Implement an HMAC construction using a secure hash function (e.g., SHA-256). 
   - This project could focus on message integrity and authentication, and you could test it by generating and verifying authentication codes.

### 3. **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**
   - Explore the Diffie-Hellman key exchange using elliptic curves, such as Curve25519 or secp256k1.
   - This could be a foundation for secure key exchange between two parties over an insecure network.

### 4. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
   - Implement simple zero-knowledge proofs, such as the classic "Fiat-Shamir" protocol.
   - This could be used for privacy-preserving authentication systems, or for cryptographic voting systems.

### 5. **Digital Signatures**
   - Build a project to generate and verify digital signatures using RSA, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), or ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).
   - You could apply this to sign transactions, messages, or files.

### 6. **Homomorphic Encryption (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)**
   - Instead of just LWE-based FHE, dive deeper into implementing a simple homomorphic encryption scheme.
   - Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can be a complex but interesting challenge, allowing computation on encrypted data without decrypting it.

### 7. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
   - With the rise of quantum computing, implementing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms such as NTRU or lattice-based schemes could be an interesting challenge.
   - This can future-proof cryptographic systems against quantum computers.

### 8. **Crypto-Agility**
   - Build a framework that allows a system to switch between different cryptographic algorithms (RSA, ECC, AES, etc.) seamlessly based on policy or performance needs. This could be useful for systems that need flexibility over time, especially in the face of evolving cryptographic research.

### 9. **Password Hashing (Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt)**
   - Implement strong password hashing algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt.
   - These algorithms add a layer of security and difficulty in cracking passwords by making the hash computation slow, which is vital in preventing brute-force attacks.

### 10. **TLS/SSL Protocol Implementation**
   - A project that implements the Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol could be challenging.
   - This involves handling encryption, message integrity, certificate validation, and key exchangeâ€”ideal for understanding how modern web security works.

### 11. **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**
   - Implement a basic version of MPC, where multiple parties can compute a result without revealing their private inputs.
   - This is a powerful technique for secure collaborative computations.

### 12. **Crypto Wallet (Bitcoin or Ethereum)**
   - Create a simple cryptocurrency wallet that can generate private/public key pairs, sign transactions, and communicate with a blockchain network (Bitcoin or Ethereum).
   - This is a great way to learn more about cryptographic principles and real-world applications.

### 13. **Cryptographic Primitives Library**
   - Build a general-purpose cryptographic library in Rust that includes common primitives like hashing functions, HMAC, PBKDF2, digital signatures, and asymmetric encryption algorithms.
   - This would be a reusable toolset for anyone implementing cryptographic systems in Rust.

### 14. **Blind Signature Schemes**
   - Implement a simple blind signature scheme such as the RSA-based blind signature.
   - This can be used for anonymous authentication or anonymous voting systems.

### 15. **Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-3, SHA-256) Optimizations**
   - Optimize cryptographic algorithms for performance, especially on specific hardware (e.g., using SIMD or parallel processing techniques).
   - This could be a great way to explore the trade-offs between security and efficiency.

### 16. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Systems**
   - Research and implement some of the post-quantum cryptographic algorithms under development to counter the power of quantum computers (e.g., code-based cryptography, multivariate quadratic equations).

### 17. **TLS/SSL Certificate Pinning**
   - Implement certificate pinning and teach how it helps mitigate MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks.
   - This would help reinforce the importance of trusted certificates and public key infrastructures.

### 18. **Blockchain and Smart Contracts**
   - Although not purely cryptographic, creating a simple blockchain from scratch would teach you many cryptographic principles like hashing, digital signatures, and consensus algorithms.
   - Implement basic smart contracts and understand the cryptographic methods behind them.

### 19. **Steganography**
   - Implement a simple steganography system where secret messages are hidden inside images, audio, or text files.
   - You could explore cryptographic methods used in hiding the information and adding security to the process.

### 20. **Cryptographic Protocols and Network Security**
   - Build your own cryptographic protocol for secure messaging or file sharing between peers.
   - Implement key exchange, encryption/decryption, and message verification, potentially exploring techniques like authenticated encryption.
