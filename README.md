# Cryptography Projects in Rust üîêüíª (aka Fe2O3-xH2O)

Welcome to my **Cryptographic Projects** repository! Here, I showcase various cryptographic implementations built using **Rust**, focusing on both classical and modern cryptographic techniques. The repository includes a range of cryptographic algorithms and systems, from foundational encryption techniques to advanced cryptographic protocols.

## Projects Overview üìÑ

### 1. **Simple FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) üîí**
   An implementation of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** in Rust. FHE allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring privacy while processing sensitive information.
### 2. **Simple RSA Encryption üîë**
   A simple implementation of the **RSA encryption** algorithm in Rust. RSA is a widely used public-key encryption scheme that is fundamental to modern cryptographic systems.


### 3. **Simple FHE-LWE (Learning With Errors) üîê**
   This project implements a basic version of **FHE-LWE (Learning With Errors)**, a cryptographic construction used for creating homomorphic encryption schemes with greater security guarantees.
   
### 4. **Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing üóùÔ∏è**
   A Rust implementation of **Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing** scheme, which allows a secret to be divided into multiple parts, requiring a threshold of parts to reconstruct the secret.

   - **Key Features**: Split secrets, reconstruct secrets from shares, and threshold-based sharing.
   - **Use Case**: Secure key management, distributed systems, and multi-party computation.

### 5. **Blockchain Implementation ‚õìÔ∏è**
   A basic implementation of a **Blockchain** in Rust. This project models the structure of a blockchain, enabling the creation of blocks, linking them together, and verifying the integrity of the chain.

   - **Key Features**: Block creation, chain management, hash validation, and proof-of-work algorithm.
   - **Use Case**: Cryptocurrencies, distributed ledgers, and decentralized applications.

### 6. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) üîí**
   An implementation of **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** in Rust. ECC is an advanced public-key cryptosystem that provides high security with smaller key sizes compared to RSA.

   - **Key Features**: Key generation, signature generation and verification, encryption, and decryption using elliptic curves.
   - **Use Case**: Secure communication, digital signatures, and modern encryption systems.

### 7. **STARK101 (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) üîç**
   A basic implementation of **STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)** in Rust. STARKs are a class of cryptographic proofs that allow for efficient verification of computations, with no trusted setup required.

   - **Key Features**: Implementation of basic STARK protocols for proving knowledge without revealing any sensitive data.
   - **Use Case**: Scalable and transparent cryptographic proofs for blockchain, privacy-preserving systems, and secure computation.


## Some future ideas
### 1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
   - Implementing AES encryption and decryption from scratch. 
   - You can explore both ECB (Electronic Codebook) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes of operation, as well as key expansion and padding schemes.

### 2. **HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)**
   - Implement an HMAC construction using a secure hash function (e.g., SHA-256). 
   - This project could focus on message integrity and authentication, and you could test it by generating and verifying authentication codes.

### 3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
   - Implement simple zero-knowledge proofs, such as the classic "Fiat-Shamir" protocol.
   - This could be used for privacy-preserving authentication systems, or for cryptographic voting systems.

### 4. **Digital Signatures**
   - Build a project to generate and verify digital signatures using RSA, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), or ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).
   - You could apply this to sign transactions, messages, or files.

### 5. **Crypto-Agility**
   - Build a framework that allows a system to switch between different cryptographic algorithms (RSA, ECC, AES, etc.) seamlessly based on policy or performance needs. This could be useful for systems that need flexibility over time, especially in the face of evolving cryptographic research.

### 6. **TLS/SSL Protocol Implementation**
   - A project that implements the Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol could be challenging.
   - This involves handling encryption, message integrity, certificate validation, and key exchange‚Äîideal for understanding how modern web security works.

### 7. **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**
   - Implement a basic version of MPC, where multiple parties can compute a result without revealing their private inputs.
   - This is a powerful technique for secure collaborative computations.

### 8. **Crypto Wallet (Bitcoin or Ethereum)**
   - Create a simple cryptocurrency wallet that can generate private/public key pairs, sign transactions, and communicate with a blockchain network (Bitcoin or Ethereum).
   - This is a great way to learn more about cryptographic principles and real-world applications.

### 9. **Cryptographic Primitives Library**
   - Build a general-purpose cryptographic library in Rust that includes common primitives like hashing functions, HMAC, PBKDF2, digital signatures, and asymmetric encryption algorithms.
   - This would be a reusable toolset for anyone implementing cryptographic systems in Rust.

### 10. **Blind Signature Schemes**
   - Implement a simple blind signature scheme such as the RSA-based blind signature.
   - This can be used for anonymous authentication or anonymous voting systems.

### 11. **Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-3, SHA-256) Optimizations**
   - Optimize cryptographic algorithms for performance, especially on specific hardware (e.g., using SIMD or parallel processing techniques).
   - This could be a great way to explore the trade-offs between security and efficiency.

### 12. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Systems**
   - Research and implement some of the post-quantum cryptographic algorithms under development to counter the power of quantum computers (e.g., code-based cryptography, multivariate quadratic equations).

### 13. **Steganography**
   - Implement a simple steganography system where secret messages are hidden inside images, audio, or text files.
   - You could explore cryptographic methods used in hiding the information and adding security to the process.

### 14. **Cryptographic Protocols and Network Security**
   - Build your own cryptographic protocol for secure messaging or file sharing between peers.
   - Implement key exchange, encryption/decryption, and message verification, potentially exploring techniques like authenticated encryption.
